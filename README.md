# Weather App

This is a weather app built with React and Typescript that showcases the current weather for a given location.
It was bootstrapped with create-react-app and uses styles and some concepts from my vanilla JS version:
https://github.com/wishesmandragora/weather-app

## Getting Started
To get started with the app, first clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git`

Then, install the dependencies:

npm install
To start the app, run:

`npm start`

This will start the app in development mode and open it in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.

## API Key
This app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. To use the API, you'll need to sign up for a free API key at https://openweathermap.org/api. Once you have an API key, create a .env.local file in the root of the project and add the following line, replacing YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key:

`REACT_APP_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY`

### Usage
To use the app, simply enter a location in the search bar and press the "Search" button. The app will fetch weather data for the given location and display it on the page.
